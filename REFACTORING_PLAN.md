# Refactoring Plan for actions-semver-checker

## Status: Phases 1-8 Complete ✅

### Original State (Before Refactoring)
- Single 1,840-line main.ps1 file
- 9 global/script variables tracking state
- 81 passing tests in main.Tests.ps1
- Functions defined inline in main.ps1
- No clear separation of concerns
- Counter-based tracking (67 increment statements)

### Current State (After Refactoring)
- **main.ps1**: 1,407 lines (-24%)
- **Modules**: 5 focused modules (1,320+ lines)
  - StateModel.ps1 (608 lines) - Domain model with diff visualization
  - GitHubApi.ps1 (432 lines)
  - Remediation.ps1 (144 lines)
  - Logging.ps1 (75 lines)
  - VersionParser.ps1 (43 lines)
- **Script variables**: 1 (down from 9, -89%)
- **Tests**: 81/81 passing (100%)
- **Domain model**: Status-based calculation
- **Smart version logic**: Calculates next available version
- **Documentation**: Complete with architecture diagrams
- **Diff visualization**: Color-coded preview of auto-fix changes

## Original Goals - All Achieved ✅
1. ✅ Improve maintainability and readability - 24% smaller main.ps1
2. ✅ Add state model with diff visualization - RepositoryState + StateDiff implemented
3. ✅ Better error handling and retry logic - Structured in modules
4. ✅ Clear separation between validation logic and remediation - Modular architecture
5. ✅ Keep all 81 tests passing - 100% pass rate maintained

## Architecture Design

### Module Structure
```
lib/
├── Logging.ps1          - Safe output, workflow command injection prevention
├── VersionParser.ps1    - Version parsing and comparison
├── GitHubApi.ps1        - All GitHub API interactions with retry logic
├── StateModel.ps1       - Domain model for current/desired state
├── Validator.ps1        - Validation rules and checks
└── Remediation.ps1      - Fix strategies (manual, auto-fix, what-if)
```

### Domain Model

```powershell
# Current State
class VersionRef {
    [string]$Version      # e.g., "v1.0.0"
    [string]$Ref          # e.g., "refs/tags/v1.0.0"
    [string]$Sha          # commit SHA
    [System.Version]$SemVer
    [bool]$IsPrerelease
    [bool]$IsPatch/IsMinor/IsMajorVersion
    [string]$Type         # "tag" or "branch"
}

class ReleaseInfo {
    [string]$TagName
    [string]$Sha
    [bool]$IsDraft
    [bool]$IsPrerelease
    [bool]$IsImmutable
    [int]$Id
}

class RepositoryState {
    [VersionRef[]]$Tags
    [VersionRef[]]$Branches
    [ReleaseInfo[]]$Releases
}

# Desired State
class ValidationIssue {
    [string]$Type         # "missing_version", "mismatched_sha", etc.
    [string]$Severity     # "error", "warning"
    [string]$Message
    [string]$FixCommand   # Manual fix command
    [bool]$IsAutoFixable
    [scriptblock]$AutoFixAction  # API or git command
}

# State Diff
class StateDiff {
    [string]$Action       # "create", "update", "delete"
    [string]$RefType      # "tag", "branch", "release"
    [string]$Version
    [string]$CurrentSha
    [string]$DesiredSha
    [string]$Reason
}
```

### Validation Flow

```
1. Collect Current State
   ├─ Local tags (git tag -l v*)
   ├─ Remote branches (git branch --remotes)
   └─ GitHub releases (REST API with pagination)

2. Calculate Desired State
   ├─ For each patch version vX.Y.Z:
   │  ├─ Should have minor vX.Y pointing to same/latest patch
   │  └─ Should have major vX pointing to same/latest patch
   ├─ Check for ambiguous refs (tag + branch with same version)
   └─ Check releases (exist, immutable, not on floating versions)

3. Generate State Diff
   └─ Compare current vs desired, output structured diffs

4. Display Diff
   ├─ Group by action type (create/update/delete)
   ├─ Color code (green=create, yellow=update, red=delete)
   └─ Show before/after SHAs

5. Execute Remediation
   ├─ Dry-run mode (default): Show manual commands
   ├─ Auto-fix mode: Execute via API/git with error handling
   └─ What-if mode: Log intended actions without executing
```

### Remediation Strategies

```powershell
class RemediationPlan {
    [ValidationIssue[]]$Issues
    [hashtable]$Dependencies  # Issue dependencies (tree structure)
    
    [ValidationIssue[]] GetExecutionOrder() {
        # Topological sort based on dependencies
        # Example: Create v1.0.0 before creating v1.0 pointing to it
    }
}
```
